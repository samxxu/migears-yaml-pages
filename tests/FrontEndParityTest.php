/**
 * The two front ends are peers over one shared compiler and one contract, and
 * nothing compared them: each package's own tests assert its own syntax, so a
 * rule that fires in one spelling and not the other had no detector at all.
 * The third-round report filed exactly that against this package — the XML
 * side refused a duplicate element while this one said nothing — and it is the
 * class of bug this file exists to catch.
 *
 * The corpus is the contract: every `*.page.yaml` under tests/fixtures/pages has
 * a `*.page.xml` at the same path in migears/xml-pages, and the two must compile
 * to byte-identical artefacts; every pair under tests/fixtures/errors must be
 * refused with the same message. Both halves are read as fixtures, so a subject
 * a front end can express differently — YAML's quoted keys against XML's
 * `<attr>` children, `"@click"` against `__click`, a section name that needs
 * trimming — is compared rather than assumed. The YAML half is also where the
 * syntax has a trap of its own: a bare `y` is a YAML 1.1 boolean, so the corpus
 * quotes it and the artefacts still have to agree.
 *
 * The error corpus holds rules of the shared layer only. A source the *parser*
 * rejects is each front end's own wording, so those stay in each package's own
 * tests.
 *
 * Two differences between the two syntaxes are deliberate, and no pair can
 * express them — they are written down here so the corpus is not read as a claim
 * that the two accept exactly the same sources:
 *
 * 1. How a value's type is decided. An XML attribute is a string, so the shared
 *    boolean parser reads it with HTML semantics: `required="1"`, `"yes"`,
 *    `"on"`, `""` and `"required"` are all true. YAML hands the compiler native
 *    scalars, so `required: 1` is an integer where a boolean is due and
 *    `rows: '4'` a string where a positive integer is due, and both are refused
 *    here. Each side is right for its own syntax, and each package's own suite
 *    pins its own reading; making them agree would mean breaking one of the two.
 * 2. Duplicate keys. A repeated mapping key cannot be seen from here at all:
 *    libyaml merges it before PHP reads the document, so the last one wins with
 *    no warning — this package documents the merge and pins it. The other half
 *    refuses the equivalent repeated element, and those errors are in its own
 *    tests. A pair would have to assert a *difference*, which is what this note
 *    is for instead.
 *
 * The sibling package is not a composer requirement of this one and cannot be
 * (the two are peers), so it is only usable when it is checked out beside this
 * package. That is the case in the monorepo and in CI; on a standalone install
 * this file skips, and CI's --fail-on-skipped turns that skip into a failure.
